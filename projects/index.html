  <h1>2019</h1>

  <h3><u>Mr. Chorder Remake</u></h3>
  This project is a remake from the project in 2016. Back in 2016, the project uses the Decision Tree on five frequencies with the largest amplitude to decide which key each note is. While in 2019, the remake would use the SVM (support vector machine) on all frequencies to decide. More features are used to make the prediction, though some of them do not contribute too much. As for now, the accuracy might improve, and I am still working on it.

  <h3><u>High-definition Video Wireless Transmission Optimization</u></h3>
  This project is my graduation design for bachelor degree. I implemented a three-end system based on my work in the paper <a href="/publications/icpads2016drone.pdf">Drone-Based Wireless Relay using Online Tensor Update</a>. The system is dedicated to solving a wireless relay problem using a machine learning method. Two of the three ends are video signal sender and receiver. The third end is the relay connected to a mobile device (in my case, a sweeping robot) that can move around to collect information for the next iteration of envionment evaluation. The mobile device is capable of finding the optimal relay location even if there are obstructions existing in the transmitting path.</br>

  <h3><a href="http://eelab.sjtu.edu.cn/kc/2015-12/C17/"><u>Android Based Car Controlling</u></a></h3>
  We use android devices to control the car!
  We implemented gesture control, speech control, gravitational control and of course, button control.
  This is a project for Science and Technology Innovation (Part 3-C).</br>
