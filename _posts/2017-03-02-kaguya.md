Promise to keep a regular diary! Though there is nothing special these days, except kept solving problems on Leetcode.

There are some interesting problems I came across when programming, for example, [Sudoku Solver](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/) and [Wildcard Matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching/?tab=Description). It took time to AC, but doing them were fun.

Recently, I have begun to implement my paper on real life situation, instead of running simulations. First thing is to solve the problem of video transmission among three ends. However, UDP sockets and video capturing were fine, frame encoding went wrong. I haven't found any solution to the access violation exception prompted during the running of program. I cannot see why the calling of a **imencode()** function from the **opencv** library threw an exception. All of the sample codes are exactly same with mine. Anyone who knows this can go to [the question I raised on Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42547099/access-violation-reading-location-when-using-imencode).

Oh, I would also like to recommend an animation movie for you, *The Tale of Princess Kaguya*, both the style and the theme are wonderful.
