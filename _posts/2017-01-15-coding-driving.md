Since I built up this blog, I never have the chance to add real stuff to it. Well now, I decide to keep a weekly diary in 2017, if I can. Things in these diaries would be casual, recording things worthy of mention during the week.

## Coding
After completing most of the graduate applications, I have some time to program finally. I decided to carry on with my journey on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). I have written codes on several problems to prepare myself for interviews from Google and Microsoft, and I think now is the time to pick it up again to strengthen my ability of programming as much as possible, before continuing my graduate study. Further more, my biggest disadvantages would be lacking in knowledge of various kinds of programming language. Thus, apart from practicing Cplusplus more, I would like to dig deeper into other programming language I am capable of and those I am not familiar with.

By Jan., 13th, I have finished up the problems left in the past, and the problem [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/) was a little challenging. But anyway, it is just a start, and more practice is coming up!

## Driving
Another goal in this winter vacation is to achieve my driving license, which has been delayed for more than one year due to the internship in Microsoft. Today is the second day I learnt to drive and also my second day to drive on road. Yes, on the first day, the coach put me in the driving seat and asked to drive on the real road. It was EXCITING, but, frankly, not-so-ready. It is, though, the quickest way to get you familiar with the vehicle.

Honestly, I think I am stuck in how to properly making a turn. One have to do so many things when turning and I know, it is just a matter of familiarity. Wish I could do better afterwards. :)

## Other Stuff
Writing this first diary is just a beginning and I wish I have time to write more stuff here. My former blogs are [here](http://user.qzone.qq.com/545133847/main) (in Chinese) and maybe I could translate some here. LOL

Oh, by the way, the comment system is offline right now. I have to take a look into whether the service is available.
